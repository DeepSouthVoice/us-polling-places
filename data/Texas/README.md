## Texas Polling Places (2012-2018)

  This collection of polling locations in Texas contains 24,962 records. It covers general elections held from 2012 to 2018. It is drawn from 505 documents obtained via open records requests and research by the Center for Public Integrity. The records cover 245 of Texas's 254 counties.
  
  Kristian Hernandez and Carrie Levine filed and followed up on the records requests. Chris Zubak-Skees wrote automated extraction code, then the collection was hand-checked and cleaned by Zubak-Skees, Taylor Johnson, Kimberly Cataudella and Joe Yerardi.
  
  Though a lot of effort went into producing a clean data set, errors almost certainly remain.
  
  Much of election administration in Texas is overseen by local officials in small counties with few resources. Though many public officials went out of their way to be helpful, some struggled to find records from prior years, or gave their best approximation based on recollection. This data relies on their account.
  
  The files received were sometimes clean Excel sheets and sometimes messy Word documents or PDFs. The locations were sometimes incomplete or missing addresses. Reporters researched the addresses when possible, but gaps still remain.
